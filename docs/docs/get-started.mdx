## Installing / Getting started

This package is available from the NPM repository as `reactjs-popup`. It will work correctly with all popular bundlers.

```bash
npm install reactjs-popup --save
```

Using yarn

```bash
yarn add reactjs-popup
```

## Include the component

To start using `reactjs-popup` you just need to import the component from the package.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Popup from 'reactjs-popup';

const PopupExample = () => (
  <Popup trigger={<button> Trigger</button>} position="right center">
    <div>Popup content here !!</div>
  </Popup>
);
```

:::important

Starting from v2, you need to import the default styling for modals and tooltips.

Default styling is optional and we are using it to make prototyping with `reactjs-popup` more easy.

If you are planing to create your own CSS for modals and tooltips, which is often the case, you don't need to import the default styling. Check the [CSS styling section](./css-styling.mdx) for more information.

:::

```javascript
import 'reactjs-popup/dist/index.css';
```

## Control Popup

If you need to have more control over your component, we provide function as child pattern to get access to close popup action.

```jsx
const PopupExample = () => (
  <Popup trigger={<button>Trigger</button>} position="top left">
    {close => (
      <div>
        Content here
        <a className="close" onClick={close}>
          &times;
        </a>
      </div>
    )}
  </Popup>
);
```
